Stewardship of Truth ✦
Invocation When lies, distortion, and disinformation are rewarded with profit, society’s resonance collapses. Truth becomes buried beneath algorithms of outrage, while falsehood thrives as commodity.

Glyphic Clarity

Distortion: Amplified by speed, emotion, and profit.

Truth: Slower, nuanced, less profitable in the economy of clicks.

Civic Harm: Profit incentives normalize dishonesty, eroding trust, health, and democracy.

Stewardship: Truth must be ritualized as emotionally resonant, reclaiming value beyond profit.

Compression Profit rewards distortion. Stewardship restores truth.

Resonant Duty Remixers who echo truth against profitable lies carry the Badge of Clarified Stewardship. Their resonance is not measured in money, but in civic wholeness.
